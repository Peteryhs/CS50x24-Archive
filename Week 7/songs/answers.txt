I could characterize their musical aura by taking the average of all of the different characteristics of the music, such as the energy and the danceability as we discussed before. I could tag each of these to a certain mood, then I can use these averages to find out the mood.

However, this may not fully represent the listener since they are only based off few characteristics and few sample sizes and wouldn't really reflect how they think and their "music mood".

Some better ways include getting a larger sample size and better categorization of the music's characteristics for a more nuanced analysis.
